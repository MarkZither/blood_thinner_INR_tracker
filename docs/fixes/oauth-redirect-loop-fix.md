# OAuth Redirect Loop Fix

## Issue Description

After successful OAuth login (Microsoft/Google), users experienced a redirect loop:
1. User tries to access `/inr` (or any protected page)
2. Gets redirected to `/login?returnUrl=inr`
3. Clicks "Sign in with Microsoft/Google"
4. Successfully authenticates with OAuth provider
5. OAuthCallback processes token exchange
6. User is authenticated and redirected to `/inr`
7. **BUG**: `/inr` page sees user as NOT authenticated
8. Redirects back to `/login?returnUrl=inr`
9. But user IS authenticated on second visit to login
10. Results in redirect loop

## Root Cause

The issue was in `OAuthCallback.razor` after successful authentication:

```csharp
// OLD CODE (BUGGY)
await AuthStateProvider.MarkUserAsAuthenticatedAsync(
    authResponse.AccessToken, 
    authResponse.RefreshToken, 
    _authenticatedPrincipal);

// Redirect WITHOUT force reload to preserve session
Navigation.NavigateTo(redirectTarget, forceLoad: false); // ❌ BUG HERE
```

### Why This Failed

When using `forceLoad: false`:
1. Navigation happens on the **same Blazor Server circuit**
2. Even though `MarkUserAsAuthenticatedAsync` calls `NotifyAuthenticationStateChanged`
3. The navigation to Dashboard happens **before** the auth state propagates to all components
4. Dashboard's `@attribute [Authorize]` still sees old (unauthenticated) state
5. Authorization middleware redirects back to login
6. On second visit, auth state has propagated, so login sees user as authenticated
7. Results in redirect loop

### Blazor Server Circuit Timing Issue

This is a known gotcha with Blazor Server:
- `NotifyAuthenticationStateChanged` is **asynchronous**
- State change notifications are queued and processed by the SignalR hub
- If you navigate immediately after notification, the target component may render with stale auth state
- This is especially problematic with `[Authorize]` attribute which checks auth synchronously

## Solution

Changed to use `forceLoad: true` with a small delay:

```csharp
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
await AuthStateProvider.MarkUserAsAuthenticatedAsync(
    authResponse.AccessToken, 
    authResponse.RefreshToken, 
    _authenticatedPrincipal);

// CRITICAL: Wait a moment for auth state to propagate to Blazor circuit
await Task.Delay(100); // ✅ Allow state change notification to process

// Use forceLoad=true to ensure entire page reloads with auth state
Navigation.NavigateTo(redirectTarget, forceLoad: true); // ✅ Full page reload
```

### Why This Works

1. **`Task.Delay(100)`**: Gives Blazor Server time to process `NotifyAuthenticationStateChanged`
   - Allows SignalR hub to propagate state to all connected circuits
   - 100ms is sufficient for state change notification to queue and process

2. **`forceLoad: true`**: Forces full page reload
   - New HTTP request to target page (e.g., `/dashboard`)
   - Fresh Blazor Server circuit created
   - `CustomAuthenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync()` called
   - Reads auth state from cache (stored by `MarkUserAsAuthenticatedAsync`)
   - Dashboard renders with correct authenticated state
   - No redirect loop!

### Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- ✅ Eliminates redirect loop completely
- ✅ Ensures consistent auth state across page transitions
- ✅ Simple and reliable solution
- ✅ Works for all protected pages (Dashboard, INR, Medications, etc.)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Full page reload is slightly slower than client-side navigation
- ❌ Loses any in-memory state (but we don't have any critical state to lose after login)
- ❌ 100ms delay adds minor latency (barely noticeable)

**Verdict:** Trade-off is acceptable for medical application where correctness > speed

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### 1. Manual State Refresh (Rejected)
```csharp
// Force AuthenticationStateProvider to refresh
var authState = await AuthStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
Navigation.NavigateTo(redirectTarget, forceLoad: false);
```
**Why rejected:** Still has race condition - target page may render before state propagates

### 2. Longer Delay (Rejected)
```csharp
await Task.Delay(500); // Longer delay
Navigation.NavigateTo(redirectTarget, forceLoad: false);
```
**Why rejected:** Still unreliable on slow connections, and user-noticeable delay

### 3. Polling Auth State (Rejected)
```csharp
// Wait until auth state is authenticated
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    var state = await AuthStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
    if (state.User.Identity?.IsAuthenticated == true)
        break;
    await Task.Delay(100);
}
Navigation.NavigateTo(redirectTarget, forceLoad: false);
```
**Why rejected:** Over-engineered, still has potential race conditions

### 4. Redirect to Intermediate Page (Rejected)
```csharp
// Redirect to /auth-success, then to final destination
Navigation.NavigateTo("/auth-success", forceLoad: true);
```
**Why rejected:** Extra page load, confusing UX, unnecessary complexity

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Direct Login to Dashboard
1. Navigate to `https://localhost:7239/login`
2. Click "Sign in with Microsoft"
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. **Expected**: Redirect to `/dashboard` WITHOUT loop
5. **Result**: ✅ PASS

### Test Scenario 2: Protected Page with ReturnUrl
1. Navigate directly to `https://localhost:7239/inr` (not authenticated)
2. Gets redirected to `/login?returnUrl=inr`
3. Click "Sign in with Microsoft"
4. Complete OAuth flow
5. **Expected**: Redirect to `/inr` WITHOUT loop
6. **Result**: ✅ PASS

### Test Scenario 3: Already Authenticated
1. Complete login once (authenticated state in cache)
2. Navigate to `/login` again
3. **Expected**: See "Already logged in" message or redirect to dashboard
4. **Result**: ✅ PASS

### Test Scenario 4: Multiple Protected Pages
1. Complete login flow to `/dashboard`
2. Navigate to `/inr` (protected)
3. Navigate to `/medications` (protected)
4. **Expected**: No redirect loops, all pages load correctly
5. **Result**: ✅ PASS

## Files Modified

- `src/BloodThinnerTracker.Web/Components/Pages/OAuthCallback.razor`:
  - Added `await Task.Delay(100)` before navigation
  - Changed `forceLoad: false` → `forceLoad: true`
  - Added code comments explaining the fix

## Related Issues

- This fix also resolves the symptom where login page would show user as authenticated after failed first navigation
- Improves overall auth state consistency across the application
- May prevent future issues with other protected pages being added

## Technical Notes

### Blazor Server Auth State Management

Blazor Server uses a **persistent circuit** over SignalR:
- `AuthenticationStateProvider` is **scoped** to the circuit
- `NotifyAuthenticationStateChanged` broadcasts to all components in the circuit
- Components using `<AuthorizeView>` or `@attribute [Authorize]` listen to these changes
- State changes are **asynchronous** and **queued**

### Best Practices

For Blazor Server authentication:
1. Always use `forceLoad: true` when navigating after auth state changes
2. If using `forceLoad: false`, ensure sufficient delay for state propagation
3. Store auth tokens in cache (IMemoryCache) or persistent storage, not just in-memory
4. Use `[Authorize]` attribute for page-level authorization
5. Use `<AuthorizeView>` for component-level conditional rendering

## Deployment Notes

- No database changes required
- No configuration changes required
- No breaking changes to API contract
- Safe to deploy immediately
- No impact on existing authenticated sessions

## Performance Impact

- Minimal: 100ms delay + full page reload ≈ 200-300ms total
- Acceptable for infrequent operation (login happens once per session)
- No impact on application performance after login

## Security Impact

- **Positive**: Ensures consistent auth state across application
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- Maintains existing OAuth security model
- Does not expose tokens or sensitive data

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the OAuth redirect loop by ensuring Blazor Server's authentication state is fully propagated before navigating to protected pages. The solution is simple, reliable, and has minimal performance impact. All test scenarios pass successfully.
