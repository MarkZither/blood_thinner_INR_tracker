## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Complete Feature 002 ‚úÖ (Current)
1. Finish technical debt items
2. Verify production deployment
3. Merge to main
4. Tag release: `v1.0-deployment-infrastructure`

### Phase 2: Feature 003 (Next)
1. Create branch from main: `feature/003-core-ui-foundation`
2. Run `speckit specify` for detailed spec
3. Run `speckit tasks` for task breakdown
4. Implement and test
5. Merge to main
6. Tag release: `v1.1-core-ui`

### Phase 3: Features 004-005 (Parallel Development Possible)
1. Both features depend on Feature 003
2. Can be developed independently by different developers
3. Feature 004 is higher priority (medication safety)
4. Both merge to main when complete
5. Tag releases independently

### Phase 4: Features 006-007 (Sequential)
1. Feature 006 must complete first (reminders infrastructure)
2. Feature 007 builds on Feature 006
3. Both are lower priority (nice-to-have vs. must-have)

## Benefits of Split

### Development Velocity
- **Smaller PRs**: 200-400 lines vs. 2000+ lines
- **Faster Reviews**: 1-2 hours vs. 1-2 days
- **Quicker Feedback**: Weekly releases vs. monthly

### Risk Management
- **Isolated Changes**: Problems affect one feature, not entire system
- **Easier Rollback**: Can revert one feature without losing others
- **Incremental Testing**: Each feature fully tested before next starts

### Team Collaboration
- **Parallel Work**: Multiple features can progress simultaneously
- **Clear Ownership**: Each feature has a clear scope and owner
- **Better Estimation**: Smaller features are easier to estimate accurately

### User Value
- **Frequent Releases**: Users see progress every 1-2 weeks
- **Earlier Feedback**: Can validate features before building dependent features
- **Prioritization**: Can adjust priorities based on user feedback

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Scope Creep**: Original feature kept expanding without formal split
2. **Mixed Concerns**: Authentication + Deployment + UI all in one branch
3. **Large PRs**: Hard to review, slow to merge
4. **Testing Debt**: Difficult to test everything at once

### What to Do Differently
1. **Define Clear Boundaries**: Each feature spec should be ‚â§2 weeks of work
2. **One Concern per Feature**: Authentication OR Deployment OR UI, not all three
3. **Continuous Integration**: Merge frequently (weekly if possible)
4. **Test-First**: Write tests before implementation for clear acceptance criteria

### Updated Guidelines (Constitution Amendment)
- Maximum feature size: 2-3 weeks of effort
- Maximum PR size: 500 lines changed (excluding generated code)
- Features must have clear dependencies documented
- Features must be independently deployable
- Specs must define success criteria upfront

## Questions & Decisions

### Q: Can Features 004 and 005 be developed in parallel?
**A**: Yes, both depend only on Feature 003 and have no dependencies on each other. However, Feature 004 (Medication Logging) is higher priority for patient safety.

### Q: Why is Feature 006 (Reminders) P3 instead of P1?
**A**: While important for user experience, the app is usable without reminders. Users can manually check their medication schedule. Reminders are valuable but not critical for MVP.

### Q: Should we use feature flags for gradual rollout?
**A**: Yes. Each feature should be behind a feature flag that can be toggled per-user or per-environment. This allows:
- Testing in production with limited users
- Quick rollback without deployment
- A/B testing different implementations

### Q: How do we handle database migrations across features?
**A**: Each feature includes its own migration scripts. Migrations are forward-only and backward-compatible for at least one release cycle.
