# Requirements Quality Checklist: Docker Deployment Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Unit tests for requirements writing (not implementation)
**Created**: 2025-10-28

---

## Requirement Completeness
- [x] CHK001 Are all infrastructure components (API, Web, Database, CI/CD, Azure resources) explicitly specified in the requirements? [Completeness, Spec §Technical Implementation]
- [x] CHK002 Are all authentication flows (Microsoft, Google, JWT) documented with acceptance criteria? [Completeness, Spec §User Stories]
- [x] CHK003 Are all configuration files and secrets management requirements listed? [Completeness, Spec §Configuration Files]
- [x] CHK004 Are health check endpoints and monitoring requirements defined for all services? [Completeness, Spec §Technical Implementation]

## Requirement Clarity
- [x] CHK007 Are 'secure' and 'encrypted' requirements quantified (e.g., AES-256, HTTPS)? [Clarity, Spec §Security Implementation]

## Requirement Consistency
- [x] CHK009 Are authentication requirements consistent between Microsoft and Google flows? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories]
- [x] CHK010 Are health check requirements consistent across API and Web containers? [Consistency, Spec §Technical Implementation]
- [x] CHK011 Are configuration and secret management requirements consistent between local and cloud environments? [Consistency, Spec §Security Implementation]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality
- [x] CHK012 Are acceptance criteria for each user story measurable and independently testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Stories]
- [x] CHK013 Are success metrics for deployment and authentication objectively verifiable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Metrics]

## Scenario Coverage
- [x] CHK014 Are requirements defined for failure scenarios (e.g., failed OAuth, failed health check, deployment errors)? [Coverage, Spec §Testing Strategy]
- [x] CHK015 Are requirements specified for edge cases (e.g., missing secrets, DB connectivity loss)? [Coverage, Spec §Testing Strategy]
- [x] CHK016 Are rollback or recovery requirements defined for deployment failures? [Coverage, Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage
- [x] CHK017 Are requirements defined for concurrent deployments or parallel service startups? [Edge Case, Spec §Technical Implementation]
- [x] CHK018 Are requirements specified for environment variable misconfiguration? [Edge Case, Spec §Configuration Files]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] CHK019 Are performance requirements (startup time, deployment time, health check latency) quantified? [Non-Functional, Spec §Success Metrics]
- [x] CHK020 Are security requirements (OWASP, AES-256, HTTPS, Key Vault) explicitly listed and traceable? [Non-Functional, Spec §Security Implementation]
- [x] CHK021 Are compliance requirements (e.g., medical disclaimer, privacy) documented? [Non-Functional, Spec §Medical Disclaimer]

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- [x] CHK022 Are all external dependencies (Azure, Docker, GitHub Actions) documented and validated? [Dependencies, Spec §Dependencies]
- [x] CHK023 Are assumptions about environment (local, cloud, secrets availability) stated? [Assumptions, Spec §Technical Implementation]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts
- [x] CHK024 Is any vague terminology (e.g., 'automatic', 'secure', 'production-ready') clarified or flagged for refinement? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Stories]
- [x] CHK025 Are there any conflicting requirements between local and cloud deployment flows? [Conflict, Spec §Technical Implementation]

**Traceability**: ≥80% of items reference spec sections or [Gap]/[Ambiguity]/[Conflict] markers.

**Checklist created:** specs/feature/002-docker-deployment-infrastructure/checklists/requirements-quality.md
**Item count:** 22

**Focus areas:** Completeness, Clarity, Consistency, Acceptance Criteria, Coverage, Edge Cases, Non-Functional, Dependencies, Ambiguities
**Depth:** Standard
**Actor/timing:** Reviewer (PR or design review)
**Explicit must-haves:** Security, deployment, authentication, health checks, measurable success metrics

Each run creates a new file. Clean up obsolete checklists as needed.
