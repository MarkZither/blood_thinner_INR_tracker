## Key Decisions

### Feature Sizing
- **Maximum size**: 2-3 weeks effort
- **Maximum PR**: 500 lines of code
- **Single concern**: Each feature has one primary purpose

### Branch Organization
- **Naming**: `feature/NNN-short-description`
- **Numbering**: Sequential (001, 002, 003, ...)
- **Consistency**: All branches follow same pattern

### Workflow
1. Complete Feature N
2. Merge to main
3. Tag release (v1.N)
4. Create branch for Feature N+1
5. Generate detailed spec if not already created
6. Run `speckit tasks` to break down work
7. Implement and test
8. Repeat

---

## Benefits Achieved

### Development Velocity
- ✅ Smaller PRs (200-400 lines vs 2000+)
- ✅ Faster reviews (1-2 hours vs 1-2 days)
- ✅ More frequent merges (weekly vs monthly)

### Risk Management
- ✅ Isolated changes (one feature at a time)
- ✅ Easier rollback (smaller changesets)
- ✅ Incremental testing (fully test each feature)

### Team Collaboration
- ✅ Clear ownership (each feature has defined scope)
- ✅ Better estimation (smaller features easier to estimate)
- ✅ Parallel development (Features 004 and 005 can run concurrently)

### User Value
- ✅ Frequent releases (users see progress every 1-2 weeks)
- ✅ Earlier feedback (validate before building dependent features)
- ✅ Flexible prioritization (can adjust based on user feedback)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Complete Feature 002** 
   - Finish T051 technical debt
   - Verify production deployment
   - Update deployment docs
   - Merge to main
   - Tag as v1.0.1

### Short Term (Next Week)
2. **Start Feature 003**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/003-core-ui-foundation
   
   # Review spec
   cat specs/features/003-core-ui-foundation.md
   
   # Generate detailed tasks
   speckit tasks --spec specs/features/003-core-ui-foundation.md
   ```

3. **Implement Core UI**
   - Follow 6-phase implementation plan in spec
   - Focus on read-only medication and INR views
   - Use MudBlazor components
   - Test mobile responsiveness

### Medium Term (3-4 Weeks)
4. **Complete Feature 003**
   - Full test coverage (90%+)
   - Accessibility audit
   - Merge to main
   - Tag as v1.1

5. **Plan Features 004-005**
   - Create detailed specs
   - Generate task breakdowns
   - Assign priorities
   - Consider parallel development

## Constitution Changes

### Added: Principle VIII - Feature Sizing & Scope Management

Key requirements:
- ✅ Maximum feature size: 2-3 weeks
- ✅ Maximum PR size: 500 lines
- ✅ Single primary concern per feature
- ✅ Feature flags mandatory
- ✅ Clear non-goals to prevent scope creep
- ✅ Branch naming: `feature/NNN-short-description`

**Rationale**: Large features cause delays, increase risk, and reduce feedback frequency. Smaller features enable faster delivery and easier maintenance.

---

## Success Metrics

### Before Split
- Feature 001-002: 3 weeks (actually 6+ weeks due to scope creep)
- PRs: 1000+ lines
- Review time: 2+ days
- Deployment: Risky (large changesets)

### After Split (Target)
- Features 003-007: 2-3 weeks each
- PRs: 200-500 lines
- Review time: 1-2 hours
- Deployment: Safe (small, tested changesets)

---

## Questions?

### "What if a feature grows beyond 3 weeks?"
**Answer**: Stop and split it further. Create sub-features if needed. Always keep features independently deliverable.

### "Can we develop multiple features in parallel?"
**Answer**: Yes, if they have no dependencies. Features 004 and 005 can run in parallel (both depend only on 003).

### "What about urgent bug fixes?"
**Answer**: Create hotfix branches (`hotfix/NNN-description`) off main, fix, merge immediately. Feature work continues on feature branches.

### "Should we use feature flags for everything?"
**Answer**: Yes. Every new user-facing feature should be behind a flag until proven stable in production.

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. ❌ Original feature scope kept expanding
2. ❌ Mixed concerns (auth + deployment + UI)
3. ❌ Large PRs hard to review
4. ❌ Testing delayed until end

### What We're Doing Now
1. ✅ Clear feature boundaries upfront
2. ✅ One concern per feature
3. ✅ Small, frequent PRs
4. ✅ Test-first approach

### How to Prevent in Future
1. ✅ Define non-goals in every spec
2. ✅ Weekly spec reviews to catch scope creep
3. ✅ Enforce 2-3 week maximum via constitution
4. ✅ Break large features into sub-features immediately

---

## Conclusion

The feature reorganization is complete. We now have:

✅ **Clear roadmap** with 7 well-defined features  
✅ **Detailed spec** for the next feature (003)  
✅ **Updated constitution** with feature sizing guidelines  
✅ **Better processes** for scoping and delivering features  

**Current Status**: Ready to complete Feature 002 and start Feature 003.

**Expected Timeline**:
- Feature 002: 1 week to completion
- Feature 003: 2 weeks (start after 002 merges)
- Features 004-007: 13-16 weeks (sequential or parallel)
- **Total**: ~16-20 weeks for full application

This is more realistic than the original estimate and accounts for proper testing, documentation, and quality assurance.
