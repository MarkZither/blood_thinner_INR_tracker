# contracts/README.md

Phase 1 requires no API changes. This feature only adds static assets (manifest, icons, service worker) and client-side registration. There are no REST or GraphQL contracts to add.

If future phases introduce offline sync or background sync endpoints, contracts will be created under this directory.
