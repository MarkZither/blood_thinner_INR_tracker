# Critical Specification Updates - Summary

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Feature**: 003 Core UI Foundation  
**Purpose**: Address 5 critical gaps identified in pre-implementation checklist

---

## Updates Applied

### ✅ 1. Authentication State Persistence (CHK008)

**Location**: `spec.md` US-003-05 Technical Requirements

**Added**:
- Startup token retrieval from localStorage
- Token validation before marking user authenticated
- Expired token handling on app load
- Persistence across browser refreshes
- Token validation before API calls

**Impact**: Developers now have clear requirements for implementing session persistence.

---

### ✅ 2. Comprehensive Error Messages (CHK010, CHK016)

**Location**: `spec.md` US-003-05 Technical Requirements

**Added**:
- HttpContext null: "Authentication service unavailable. Please try again." (with retry button)
- Authentication failed: "Sign-in failed. Please check your credentials and try again."
- No access token: "Authorization incomplete. Please sign in again."
- Token storage failed: "Unable to complete sign-in. Check browser settings allow localStorage."
- Network error: "Connection lost. Please check your internet connection."
- Token expired: "Your session expired. Please sign in again."
- Token invalid: "Your session is invalid. Please sign in again."
- Refresh failed: "Your session expired. Please sign in again."

**Impact**: User experience improved with clear, actionable error messages for all failure scenarios.

---

### ✅ 3. Refresh Token Flow Specification (CHK011, CHK028)

**Location**: `spec.md` US-003-05 Technical Requirements

**Added**:
- **Trigger**: Automatic on 401 response
- **Process**: 4-step flow (extract token → call refresh → store new token → retry original call)
- **Concurrency Protection**: SemaphoreSlim lock to prevent multiple simultaneous refreshes
- **User Experience**: Transparent with brief loading state
- **Security**: Token rotation on each refresh

**Additional**: Pseudocode in `tasks.md` T003-001 for concurrent refresh handling

**Impact**: Developers have complete specification for implementing automatic token refresh without race conditions.

---

### ✅ 4. Token Storage Security Details (CHK017)

**Location**: `spec.md` US-003-05 Technical Requirements

**Added**:
- Storage location: localStorage for "remember me", sessionStorage for session-only
- Encryption: Not required (origin-isolated by browser)
- XSS protection: Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Clear on logout: Both localStorage AND sessionStorage
- Validate origin: Browser-enforced origin isolation
- No cookies: Avoid CSRF attacks

**Additional**: Partial authentication state handling (token present but invalid)

**Impact**: Clear security posture documented, XSS/CSRF mitigation strategies defined.

---

### ✅ 5. Authentication Threat Model (CHK021)

**Location**: `spec.md` new section after US-003-05

**Added**:
- **7 Threats Addressed**: Unauthorized access, XSS, network interception, session fixation, CSRF, token replay, expired token exploitation
- **Threats NOT Addressed**: MFA, biometrics, device fingerprinting (deferred to future features)
- **Security Assumptions**: 7 documented assumptions (OAuth providers trusted, HTTPS enforced, etc.)
- **Security Testing Requirements**: 8 verification tests for T003-001

**Impact**: Complete security analysis documented, testing requirements clear, future enhancements identified.

---

### ✅ 6. Rollback Plan (CHK027)

**Location**: `tasks.md` T003-001 after Testing section

**Added**:
- **Immediate Rollback Steps**: Revert DI registration, disable OAuth routes, restore Bootstrap dropdown
- **Verification After Rollback**: 3 checks to confirm system restored
- **No Data Migration Required**: No database changes, no data loss
- **Communication**: Git commit message template, GitHub issue creation
- **Rollback Decision Criteria**: 4 criteria for when to rollback vs forward fix
- **Forward Fix vs Rollback**: Guidance on decision-making

**Impact**: Risk mitigation documented, team has clear process for handling regressions.

---

### ✅ 7. Authentication Logging with Levels (CHK013)

**Location**: `spec.md` US-003-05 Technical Requirements

**Added**:
- **Information**: "User {UserId} authenticated successfully via {Provider}"
- **Warning**: "Authentication attempt failed for {Provider}: {Reason}"
- **Error**: "Token validation failed: {Reason}"
- **Debug**: "Auth state: IsAuthenticated={bool}, HasToken={bool}, TokenExpiry={datetime}"
- **Security**: All logs must exclude sensitive data (no tokens, passwords, PII)

**Impact**: Standardized logging approach for debugging and security monitoring.

---

### ✅ 8. Partial Authentication State Handling (CHK029)

**Location**: `spec.md` US-003-05 Technical Requirements

**Added**:
- Token present but invalid: Clear storage, redirect to login
- Token present but 403 Forbidden: Keep authenticated, show access denied
- Differentiation between 401 (unauthenticated) and 403 (unauthorized)

**Impact**: Edge case handling documented, prevents confusing user experience.

---

### ✅ 9. Service Layer Error Handling (CHK052)

**Location**: `tasks.md` T003-002 (Create Service Layer)

**Added**:
- Result<T> pattern for success/failure wrapper
- Exception handling mapping (HttpRequestException, JsonException, TaskCanceledException)
- No exceptions thrown to UI layer
- Logging requirements with correlation IDs
- Result<T> code example

**Impact**: Consistent error handling pattern across all services, improved debuggability.

---

### ✅ 10. API Retry/Timeout Requirements (CHK053)

**Location**: `tasks.md` T003-002 (Create Service Layer)

**Added**:
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Retry Policy**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Retry Conditions**: Network errors, 5xx errors, timeouts
- **No Retry Conditions**: 4xx errors, 401/403 handled separately
- **Implementation**: Polly library with code example

**Impact**: Resilient API communication, better user experience during transient failures.
