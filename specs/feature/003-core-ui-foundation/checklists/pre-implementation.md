# Pre-Implementation Gate Checklist: Core UI Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate requirement quality before beginning T003-001 (Critical Authentication Fix) implementation. This checklist ensures specifications are complete, clear, consistent, and measurable - "unit tests for requirements writing."

**Created**: October 29, 2025  
**Feature**: [Feature 003: Core UI Foundation](../spec.md)  
**Audience**: Developer (Author)  
**Depth**: Standard  
**Focus**: Authentication + UI Requirements Quality

**Note**: This checklist tests the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES, not the implementation. Each item asks whether requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for coding.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review each checklist item before starting T003-001
2. Address any gaps or ambiguities identified
3. Update spec.md/tasks.md to resolve uncovered issues
4. Use this as acceptance gate - all items should be clear before coding

**Focus Areas** (Per Q1/Q2/Q3 Answers):
- ✅ Pre-Implementation Gate (validates spec readiness)
- ✅ Standard depth (balanced coverage)
- ✅ Authentication + UI emphasis (critical domains)
