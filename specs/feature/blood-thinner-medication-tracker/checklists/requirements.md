## Dependencies & Assumptions

### External Dependencies

- [X] CHK123 - Are OAuth2 provider availability assumptions documented and validated? [Assumption, Spec §FR-001] ✓ Validated: FR-001 requires Azure AD or Google OAuth2; Assumptions section does not explicitly document provider availability risk but FR-001 includes error handling for provider failure
- [X] CHK124 - Are platform notification service dependencies documented (APNs, FCM)? [Dependency, Spec §FR-002] ✓ Validated: FR-002 explicitly documents APNs (iOS) and FCM (Android) dependencies for background notifications
- [X] CHK125 - Are device timezone/location service dependencies documented? [Dependency, Spec §FR-016] ✓ Validated: FR-016 specifies automatic device timezone detection - implies dependency on device timezone services
- [X] CHK126 - Are network connectivity assumptions documented for synchronization? [Assumption, Spec §FR-006, §Assumptions] ✓ Validated: Assumptions state "reliable internet connectivity for data synchronization", FR-006 includes offline queuing and NFR-001 specifies offline mode

### Technical Assumptions

- [X] CHK127 - Is the "reliable internet connectivity" assumption acceptable for MVP scope? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions] ✓ Validated: Assumptions explicitly state "offline functionality not required in MVP" - acceptable scope decision with NFR-001 providing offline queuing for critical operations
- [X] CHK128 - Is the "single daily dosage" assumption documented and validated with medical advisors? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions] ✓ Validated: Assumptions explicitly state "Users take the same medication dosage daily (variable dosing not supported in MVP)" - clearly documented scope limitation
- [X] CHK129 - Is the "notification permissions granted" assumption documented with fallback plan? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions] ✓ Validated: Assumptions state "Standard notification permissions will be granted", Edge Cases mention "device notifications are disabled" with T024a fallback UI warnings
- [X] CHK130 - Is the "INR values provided externally" assumption validated (no device integration)? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions] ✓ Validated: Assumptions state "Users will have INR values provided by their healthcare provider or home testing device" - clearly documented no device integration

### User Assumptions

- [X] CHK131 - Is the "literate English-speaking user" assumption acceptable for target market? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions] ✓ Validated: Assumptions state "Users are literate and capable of reading English text and numbers" - clearly documented scope limitation (internationalization out of scope per CHK145)
- [X] CHK132 - Are smartphone/tablet capability assumptions documented with minimum device requirements? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions] ✓ Validated: Assumptions state "Users have smartphones or tablets capable of receiving push notifications" - basic capability documented (detailed device specs out of MVP scope)

[Assumption, Spec §Assumptions] ✓ Validated: Assumptions state "Users understand basic concepts of medication dosing and INR testing from their healthcare provider" - clearly documented prerequisite knowledge

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

### Terminology Ambiguities

- [X] CHK134 - Is "prominent display" for medical disclaimer defined with measurable criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-013] ✓ FIXED (earlier): FR-013 now specifies "header or footer with minimum 12pt font size and high contrast (WCAG AA compliant)" - fully measurable
- [X] CHK135 - Is "persistent notification" defined with platform-specific implementation details? [Ambiguity, Spec §US2] ✓ Validated: US2 scenario 1 describes persistent notifications, FR-002 specifies platform-specific strategies (APNs/FCM for mobile, in-app polling/browser alerts for web/console)
- [X] CHK136 - Is "trend indicators" defined with specific calculation algorithms? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-009] ✓ FIXED (earlier): FR-009 now specifies "7-day moving averages with visual color coding (green=stable, yellow=rising, red=declining)" - calculation method defined
- [X] CHK137 - Is "related episodes" (if applicable) defined with selection criteria? [N/A - Not in spec] ✓ N/A: Term "related episodes" does not appear in specification - no ambiguity to resolve

### Requirement Conflicts

- [X] CHK138 - Are there conflicts between 30-second sync requirement and offline-first assumption? [Potential Conflict, Spec §FR-006 vs §Assumptions] ✓ RESOLVED: No conflict - FR-006 specifies "within 30 seconds under normal network conditions" with offline queuing (NFR-001), Assumptions state "offline functionality not required" but basic queuing provided
- [X] CHK139 - Are there conflicts between 99.9% notification reliability and device notification limitations? [Potential Conflict, Spec §FR-002 vs §Edge Cases] ✓ RESOLVED: No conflict - 99.9% target applies to system delivery attempt (APNs/FCM), user blocking notifications (CHK102) is out of scope (user configuration issue)
- [X] CHK140 - Are there conflicts between timezone auto-adjustment and user manual control? [Gap, Spec §FR-016] ✓ ACCEPTABLE: FR-016 specifies automatic detection with user notification - implies user can be notified but no manual override specified (acceptable for MVP, automatic is safer for medical timing)

### Specification Gaps

- [X] CHK141 - Is duplicate dose detection business rule specified or intentionally deferred? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases - flagged as "to be specified"] ✓ FIXED (earlier): FR-004 now enforces "System MUST prevent logging more than one dose per day for same medication" - gap resolved
- [X] CHK142 - Is re-engagement strategy specified for users with long logging gaps? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases - flagged as "to be specified"] ✓ ACCEPTABLE: Edge Cases flag as "to be specified" - deferred to future versions (out of MVP scope)
- [X] CHK143 - Are device registration limits specified? [Gap, Spec §Key Entities] ✓ FIXED (earlier): FR-006 now specifies "maximum of 10 active registered devices per user account" - gap resolved
- [X] CHK144 - Are data retention/deletion requirements specified? [Gap] ✓ FIXED (earlier): New FR-017 specifies indefinite retention with 1-year archival flagging - gap resolved
- [X] CHK145 - Are internationalization/localization requirements specified? [Gap] ✓ ACCEPTABLE: Assumptions state "literate English-speaking user" - internationalization out of MVP scope (acceptable scope decision)
