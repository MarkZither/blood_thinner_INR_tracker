  Pester scaffold removed

  This file was a temporary test scaffold created in error during a previous edit.
  Per the project's speckit workflow instruction, no runnable scripts or test code
  should be added at the spec/tasks stage. The test scaffolding was removed and
  any testing work should be tracked as tasks in the spec/tasks artifacts.

  If and when automated test scaffolds are authorized, they will be created in a
  separate change that follows the speckit specify/implement plan.
