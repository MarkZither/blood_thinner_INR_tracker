# Test scaffolding removed

This README previously documented a Pester scaffold that was added in error. Per the
speckit workflow for this feature, no test code or runnable scripts should be
committed during the specification and task-planning phase. The scaffold has been
removed and testing work remains a tracked task in `specs/007-internal-deployment-to/tasks.md` (T049).

When the team approves creating test scaffolds, a dedicated change will add them
with accompanying documentation and a reproducible test-run instruction set.
