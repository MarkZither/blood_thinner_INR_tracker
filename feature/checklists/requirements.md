**Purpose**: Validate requirements quality for Blood Thinner INR Tracker (mobile & web, all requirement types)  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Depth**: Formal release gate  
**Audience**: Reviewer (PR/release)  
**Focus**: All platforms, functional & non-functional requirements

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are all user roles and actors explicitly defined in the requirements? [Completeness, Spec §Actors]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are all primary user actions (dose logging, INR logging, alarm, history viewing) fully specified? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are configuration options (e.g., INR frequency) requirements documented for both platforms? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are requirements for data persistence and user-specific history included? [Completeness, Spec §Data]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 - Are terms like "difficult to accidentally dismiss alarm" defined with objective criteria? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK006 - Is the process for logging dose and INR unambiguously described for both mobile and web? [Clarity, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [ ] CHK007 - Are requirements for charting and data visualization specified with measurable properties? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK008 - Are configuration flows (e.g., setting INR frequency) described with clear steps? [Clarity, Spec §User Scenarios]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK009 - Are requirements for similar features (e.g., alarm, logging) consistent across mobile and web? [Consistency, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK010 - Are authentication and data access requirements consistent for all user actions? [Consistency, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK011 - Are success criteria for each user story measurable and technology-agnostic? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are acceptance criteria defined for non-functional requirements (e.g., accessibility, security)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 - Are requirements defined for all primary, alternate, and exception flows (e.g., missed alarm, failed login)? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [ ] CHK014 - Are requirements specified for first-time user and returning user scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [ ] CHK015 - Are requirements for data sync and multi-device usage addressed? [Coverage, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 - Are requirements defined for edge cases (e.g., no INR required, skipped dose, device offline)? [Edge Case, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK017 - Are requirements for error handling and user feedback in failure scenarios included? [Edge Case, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK018 - Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements on both platforms? [Non-Functional, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK019 - Are security and privacy requirements for user data documented? [Non-Functional, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK020 - Are performance requirements (e.g., alarm responsiveness, data sync speed) quantified? [Non-Functional, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK021 - Are all external dependencies (e.g., authentication provider, charting library) documented? [Dependency, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK022 - Are key assumptions (e.g., user has regular internet access) explicitly stated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK023 - Are all ambiguous terms (e.g., "persistent", "user-specific") clarified or referenced? [Ambiguity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK024 - Are there any conflicting requirements between mobile and web platforms? [Conflict, Spec §Functional Requirements]
